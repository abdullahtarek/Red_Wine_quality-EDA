# Red wine quality
This project is aimed to explore the red wines data set from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009) to understand what is responsible responsible for making wine high or low quality. After I get what columns contribute most to the wine quality I put it into a logistic regressiong model to classify what is the quality level given the chosen columns.

## Requirements
* R
* ggplot
* dplyr
* tydr

## Project outline
This project covers Univariate, Bivariate and multivariate analysis by using bar plots,histograms,box-plots and scatter plots. Those plots help me understand which columns correlated with the wine quality.

After choosing the columns that are most correlated with quality, I put those columns into a logistic regression model to predict the wine qulaity given the chosen attributes.
